#  Secure Network Implementation Project report 

**Description:**  
This document serves as a comprehensive project report demonstrating secure network design and the practical application of network security principles. It covers real-world scenarios, highlighting the identification and mitigation of network vulnerabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **Secure Network Design**:
  - A detailed secure network topology for three interconnected locations: Clayton, Caulfield, and Peninsula.
  - Implementation of VPNs to secure communication channels between locations.
  - Configurations for firewalls to ensure robust network protection against unauthorized access.

- **Practical Simulations**:
  - **TCP Protocol Security**:
    - Exploration of TCP vulnerabilities through tasks such as Reset Attacks and Session Hijacking.
    - Demonstrated use of packet manipulation tools to simulate these vulnerabilities.
  - **DNS Protocol Security**:
    - Execution of DNS Spoofing and Remote DNS Cache Poisoning attacks.
    - Simulation of Kaminskyâ€™s attack technique to highlight DNS weaknesses.

- **Technical Implementations**:
  - Use of Python and Scapy for packet crafting and attack simulation.
  - Firewall rule implementation and intrusion detection system (IDS) setup for enhanced security.
  - Demonstration of configurations and results using tools like GNS3.

- **Recommendations and Ethical Practices**:
  - Proposed countermeasures to mitigate vulnerabilities, including encryption, multi-factor authentication, and strict firewall rules.
  - Emphasis on ethical network usage, responsible digital practices, and data privacy.
